# DecisionTrees-In-CPP

# Purpose of the Project
Education data modelling employs classification algorithms and the decision tree classification learning process simplifies the process of classifying data. The purpose is to imply decision trees algorithm for prediction and evaluation of scores of individual students for each academic term. The model's goal is to offer a method that spares both the institutes and the students' time and effort.

# Project Scope
This project involves Educational Data Mining (EDM) which is used by educational institutions to provide better service to their students. This also allows the academic institutions to use stored data to improve teaching and learning processes. The goal is to evaluate studentsâ€™ performance and identify at-risk students and identify priority learning needs for different groups of students to create interventions and improve their performance.4

# Project Features
The main feature of the model is that it predicts the grades of individual students based on the available data.  
The model uses C4.5, ID3 and CART decision tree algorithms as reference for evaluating the scores of the students.
